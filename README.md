-The Trading Application code is an implementation of a simple banking and crypto trading system. 
The program defines an Account class with various member functions for depositing, withdrawing money, buying and selling crypto, checking transaction history, and getting account information.

-This program includes a random factor that influences the decision to buy crypto. If the user has enough equity, they can choose to buy either dogecoin or bitcoin. However, a random number generator influences the decision to buy, and the transaction will only proceed if the condition is fulfilled .
